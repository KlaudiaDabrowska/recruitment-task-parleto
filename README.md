# Recrutiment task - Parleto

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is an application that displays a list of workers and two forms:

1. One form is for searching workers by name, department and salary.
2. The second form allows adding a new worker.

Below the list of workers, is a component of summary of salary per department.
